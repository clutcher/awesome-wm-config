# Desrciption

Set of configs and install scripts to setup Desktop Environment. These scripts are designed to be executed on fresh core
debian installation (no environments checkboxes during installation).

### Would be installed:

+ LightDM as login manager
+ AwesomeWM as tiling window manager
+ Theming AwesomeWM (awesome-copycats themes with custom rc.lua)
+ Tools to work with Hardware (network, bluetooth, sound)
+ Minimal set of xfce4/gtk based applications
+ Configuration of touchpad and backlight
+ Installation various dev tools (Intellij IDEA, Java/sdkman, NodeJS/nvm, Docker etc.)
+ Installation of Obsidian and insync

P.S. Be careful with configure_global_settings.sh - it setups git global user to my personal email.
