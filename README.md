# awesome-wm-config
Set of configs and install scripts to setup and configure my personal work environment on clean system.


This scripts is designed to be executed on bare debian based system. 

#### Would be installed:
+ Awesome wm + lightdm + slock
+ Minimal set of gtk based programs required for proper system functioning (network-manager, gnome-terminal, nautilus etc)
+ Setup awesome-copycats themes with custom rc.lua
+ Configure touchpad and backlight
+ Install various dev tools (Intellij IDEA, Java/sdkman, NodeJS/nvm, sublime text etc)

P.S. Be careful with configure_global_settings.sh - it setups git global user to my personal email.
